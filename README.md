# vChat
my sat project
This is a school project for Software Development Unit 3/4

## What is vChat?
“vChat” is a real-time video communication web-based application software solution that is designed around simplicity. 
This project will be hosted on a web page and can only be accessed through web interfaces such as “Chrome”. 
It is going to be using the user’s webcam and the voice input to communicate with the clients/users on the other end, if they do not wish to use either, the option of a chat bubble and a custom profile picture will be included. 
This server can host up to 1-4 people per calling session.  
Users will be required to input a set of data to identify themselves when accessing the website. 
They will be able to also send messages, files and all the essential necessities of communication. 
But before anything, they must be able to create an account to store all relevant information for operation.
